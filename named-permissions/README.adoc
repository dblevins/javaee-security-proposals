# named-permissions

Named Permissions are defined in the [Octopus](https://bitbucket.org/contribute-bitbucket/javaeesecurityfirst) framework and are an extension to the DomainPermissions of Apache Shiro (see [Permissions in shiro](https://shiro.apache.org/permissions.html).

The name is just an nicer way to refer to a permission (_OrderCreate_ instead of _order:create_ but more descriptive name can be given for some less saying permissions.

This corresponds to the Jira issue 14 [Introduce Concept of Permissions in Authorization](https://java.net/jira/browse/JAVAEE_SECURITY_SPEC-14)

## Implied permissions

An important aspect of the *DomainPermission*s in Shiro are the possibility to have implied permissions through the use of wild cards.

So a user who has the permission _order_ has also the permission _oder:create_.

## PermissionsRequired

This is like the *RolesAllowed* annotation but then based on the NamedPermission concept.

## Scenario how it can work.

There needs to be a list of all permissions which are available in the application (just like for the roles).  The can be defined by configuration (XML) but also pragmatically.

When the code encounters the @PermissionsRequired annotation, it retrieves from the central location the permissions object.  And verifies if the Caller/Subject has the permission (implied or directly, this doesn't matter).

The implementation of this check is done in javax.security.auth.NamedPermission#implies(NamedPermission)
